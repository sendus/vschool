        <h1>CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years</h1>
    
<h2>Director Demands Investigation </h2>

    <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the<br> CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
        <br/>
    According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
